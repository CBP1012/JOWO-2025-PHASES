# Workshop on Promoting Healthy Aging through Semantic Enrichment of Social Science (PHASES)

## 15th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS 2025)

**Dates:** 08-12 September 2025 (Catania, Sicily)

## Workshop Overview

This workshop—associated with the National Institute of Health funded project *Promoting Healthy Aging through Semantic Enrichment of Solitude Research (PHASES)* (NIH Grant #R01AG075745)—focuses on advancing social science research concerning healthy aging through the application of semantic technologies. With an emphasis on **gerotranscendence, narrative identity, and solitude**, we will explore how **ontologies and knowledge graphs** enrich disparate data in social science research.

Varied definitions, measurement methods, and theoretical frameworks often hinder effective synthesis across theory and research on **solitude, narrative identity, and gerotranscendence**. For example, solitude research often focuses on short-term psychological states (of being alone), while narrative identity research addresses long-term identity development and meaning-making, and gerotranscendence studies explore shifts in life perspectives among older adults. Although there are some obvious overlaps, inconsistencies in construct definitions and methodologies across the different areas have limited integration of this research. Thus, there is a clear need for **ontologies to bridge gaps across disciplines, standardize definitions, and enable interdisciplinary collaboration**.

This workshop will address these pressing challenges by bringing together researchers from **psychology, philosophy, ontology engineering, and public health**. Together, we will discuss the **design and application of ontologies** to clarify constructs, integrate data, and develop novel tools for interdisciplinary research.

With these goals in mind, we invite **submissions** for this workshop, which will be held as part of the **Joint Ontologies Workshop (JOWO) episode XI**, affiliated with **FOIS 2025**.
